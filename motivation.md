## So what's the point of Databases and Data Persistence? 🤔

Well hackers, I'm glad you asked! Here at HackBU, we want to help you work on some cool projects and give you the tools you need to do what you want to do.

Programming is pretty cool because you get to let computers do your bidding. But what happens when you need your program to remember information from previous times that you've you used it?

Let's look at some examples of this:
* You're building a game and you want your program to remember the high score even after it stops running.
* You're building a social media platform that allows user to submit posts for the world to see!
* You're writing a program that sends you a copy of your shopping list (or any kind of list for that matter) at a time designated by you (the user)

See? There are plenty of reasons why you might want to use databases and/or data persistence in your project. Most sophisticated programs use them these days, so it might be a good idea to consider.
