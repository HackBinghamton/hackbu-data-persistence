# Data Persistence (and a Tiny Bit about Databases)

Welcome to the workshop! Today we're going to be talking about Databases and Data Persistence. It sounds advanced, but we promise its not. It's actually really cool and once you learn it, you'll be able to use it to make your personal projects twice as awesome!

*And since it sounds so advanced, you'll sound extra smart when you talk about it with other people (since you are already smart, you smarty! ðŸ¤“)*

To get started, head over to [`motivation.md`](./motivation.md) to read about the uses of databases and data persistence.

As always, please ask for help from an organizer (they're literally everywhere) if you get lost. We're here to help, so don't hesitate. And be sure to be respectful of your fellow hackers. It's gonna be a fun time!
